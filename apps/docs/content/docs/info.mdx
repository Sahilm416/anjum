All these methods have a similar return type. The return type is a object that consist two fields as success and message.
`success` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation was successful or not and the `message` is the information of the operation.

Integrate these methods into your ui using this returned object.
You can display the notification messages using the success state of the returned object.

Here is a demo of how to use it.

```typescript
import { login } from "@/actions/anjum";
import { toast } from "sonner";

const handleLogin = async ({
  email,
  password,
}: {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}) => {
  const res = await login({ email: email, password: password });
  if (res.success) {
    // login successful
    toast.success(res.message)
    // redirect to dashboard
  } else {
    // login failed
    // show error message
    toast.error(res.message)
  }
};
```
