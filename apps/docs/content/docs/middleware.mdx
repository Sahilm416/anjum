title: middleware

Middleware is a piece of code that works as a interface between your client and server.
It is used to perform tasks such as authentication, caching, and error handling. If you are new to this concept kindly check [nextjs middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware). <br/>
Here is a simple example of middleware in nextjs.

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { getSession } from "@/actions/anjum";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
  const session = await getSession();
  //if already authenticated then redirect back to desired page
  if (url.pathname === "/login") {
    if (session.success) {
      //add path where logged in user should be redirected
      url.pathname = "/";
      return NextResponse.redirect(url);
    } else {
      return NextResponse.next();
    }
  }
  //this redirects the users to auth page if not authenticated
  if (session.success) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  } else {
    url.pathname = "/login";
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }
}

export const config = {
  //add routes in matcher array to protect them from unauthenticated users
  matcher: ["/", "/login"],
};
```

Depending on your need you can always edit the middleware file and add or remove routes.
