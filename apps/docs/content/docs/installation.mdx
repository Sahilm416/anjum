import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";
import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Complete the following steps as directed to use the `project anjum` authentication in your app.
Kindly follow each and every step to setup the authentication.

<Steps>
<Step>
  ## Configure environment variables
  ```bash
   NEON_KEY=your_neon_key
   MAIL_USER=your_email
   MAIL_PASS=your_password
  ```
  Go to the [neon console](https://console.neon.tech/) to get your `NEON_KEY` i.e. *"connection string"* &nbsp; from the project dashboard.
  If you want to use the email methods then make sure to also provide the `MAIL_USER` and `MAIL_PASS` too. <br/>

The `MAIL_USER` is simply the email address that you want to use to send emails to your users. <br/>
To get the `MAIL_PASS` follow the following steps. <br/>

1. Go to your gmail account.
2. Tap on profile and click "manage your google account".
3. Go to security tab and scroll down to check if you have enabled two factor authentication. (if not then enable it)
4. Go to search bar and search for "App passwords".
5. click on it and enter your gmail password if prompted.
6. Now enter your app name and click "create".
7. You'll get the password string on screen.

{" "}
<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  Remove the extra spaces in the password.
</Callout>

It should look something like this.

```bash
MAIL_PASS=bqderhgnwijknlnz
```

{" "}
<Callout title="Warning" type="warn">
  Do not change the naming of specified environment variables.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
 
### Install package

<Tabs id="package" defaultIndex={1} items={["pnpm", "npm"]}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
   pnpm install anjum 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
   npm install anjum 
   ```
   </Tab>
</Tabs>
This will install the necessary files from the npm registry. Depending on the internet
connection it'll complete the installation.

</Step>

<Step>

### Initialize the project

<Tabs id="package" defaultIndex={1} items={["pnpm", "npm"]}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
   pnpx anjum init 
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
   npx anjum init 
   ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Project anjum requires the configuration with server actions to run.
This command will automatically figure out the project structure and create the necessary files.
Just make sure you have your `NEON_KEY` in your `env` file.
Also add the `MAIL_USER` and `MAIL_PASS` if you need email service.

</Step>

<Step>
## Import methods
Now you are all set to import the methods in both client and server components.
Here is an example of how you can import and use the methods in your component.

```typescript
import { login, register, logout } from "@/actions/anjum";

const handleLogin = async ({
  email,
  password,
}: {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}) => {
  const res = await login({ email: email, password: password });
  return res;
};
```

</Step>
</Steps>
