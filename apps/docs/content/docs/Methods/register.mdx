title: register
---

This method lets you add new users to the database. Just pass the email and password along with the role. <br/>
The role could be "user" or "admin". 

```typescript
import { register } from "@/actions/anjum";

const handleRegister = async ({email , password} : {email: string , password: string})=> {
   const res = await register({email: email , password: password , role: "user"});
   return res;
}
// returns {success: boolean , message: string}
 ```

 ## More about it
 Before directly using the `register` method make sure you have confirmed the email address by the [email verification](/docs/Methods/email) method.
