import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

This method allows to delete the user from the database. All you need is to pass the email.
Here is a demo code.

```typescript
import { deleteAccount } from "@/actions/anjum";

const handleDeleteAccount = async ()=> {
    const res = await deleteAccount({email: email});
    return res;
};
// returns {success: boolean , message: string}
```

Always add confirmation modals and notifications to let the user delete their account.

<Callout title="Warning" type="warn">
     This can't be undone !
</Callout>
